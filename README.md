Linguo - Word Game

https://diegodgava.github.io/project-linguo/

Welcome to Linguo, an addictive and challenging word game! Linguo is a CS50 final project inspired by the New York Times' game, Wordle. It has been developed to provide users with a fun and interactive word-guessing experience.

Description
Linguo is a word game where the objective is to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. Each hidden word is randomly generated from an internal dictionary within the game. The player must use their deduction skills to uncover the word by guessing different combinations of letters. The game provides feedback on the correctness of each guess, guiding the player towards the correct word.

Features
Unlimited Gameplay: Unlike the original Wordle game, Linguo allows players to enjoy the game as many times as they want. There are no daily word restrictions, enabling players to challenge themselves with different words endlessly.

Scoring System: Linguo keeps track of the player's performance by maintaining a score. The score increases with each successful guess, and it resets when the player wins or loses the game. Compete against yourself and aim for higher scores with every play!

Word Generation: The game generates words randomly from a built-in dictionary, ensuring a diverse and engaging gameplay experience. Each word is carefully selected to provide an appropriate level of challenge to the player.

Responsive Interface: The game interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring smooth gameplay across different devices and screen sizes. The intuitive layout allows players to focus on the game and enjoy a seamless experience.


We hope you enjoy playing Linguo as much as we enjoyed creating it. Have fun and happy word-guessing!
